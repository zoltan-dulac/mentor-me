	<strong>JANET BANKS</b> (writer): &ldquo;I am inspired by the human
	condition as it unfolds around me a million times every day, next
	door and across the oceans. I have had the opportunity to travel
	the world and observe how the human condition is informed by
	culture, history and world events. People tell me stories and I
	attempt to capture them for the stage.&rdquo;</p>
	
	<p >
	Janet worked for the Royal Ontario Museum between 1984-1990: first
	as a security administrator, but then promoted to Head of Security
	2 years later, making her not only the first woman hired for the
	job but also the youngest person ever. During her career, a few
	highlights included shaking hands with Queen Elizabeth II, playing
	hide and seek with an international jewel thief and personally
	escorting the road transport of precious Jewish artifacts from
	Houston to Toronto while under a terrorist threat from the PLO.</p>
	
	<p >
	Written plays (unpublished) include: <i><strong>The Acorn Trilogy</b></i>
	(<i><strong>Dirty Little Secret</b></i>, <i><strong>My Brother&rsquo;s
	Keeper</b></i> and <i><strong>Inspiration Stump</b></i>), <i><strong>1000
	Cleopatras</b></i>, <i><strong>Hand Washing Techniques</b></i>,
	<i><strong>Pilgrimage</b></i>, <i><strong>Season Tickets</b></i>, <i><strong>Maybe
	It&rsquo;s Mabeleen</b></i>, <i><strong>Rice Pudding</b></i>, <i><strong>In
	the Beginning</b></i>, <i><strong>Wilde&rsquo;s Women</b></i> and
	<i><strong>Sundance</b></i>, of which 4 were produced.</p>
	
	<p >
	Janet has had the privilege of having 2 incredible mentors: the
	Interim Head of Security of the ROM who hired her, whose actual
	name, unfortunately isn&rsquo;t available, and Timothy Findley.
	When she first met Timothy, it was in a class for aspiring
	writers. While critiquing students&rsquo; work in class, after
	reading her first piece, Timothy told Janet: <i>&ldquo;All I can
	say to you is just keep writing.&rdquo;</i> Before he passed away,
	Janet had the amazing experience of corresponding with Timothy
	while she wrote <i><strong>Pilgrimage</b></i>.</p>
	
	<p >
	<i><strong>Mentor Me Through This Wonderland</b></i> was originally an
	unfinished book entitled <i><strong>Friends with Benefits</b></i> and
	adapted for stage by her widowed husband, Lorne Hiro.  Janet
	passed away November, 2011.</p>

	<strong>LORNE HIRO </b>(actor, writer, producer):  Out of Janet&rsquo;s
	plays, Lorne was privileged to perform in three (<i><strong>My
	Brother&rsquo;s Keeper</b></i>, <i><strong>Maybe It&rsquo;s Mabeleen</b></i>,
	and <i><strong>Inspiration Stump</b></i>) and to direct <i><strong>Rice
	Pudding</b></i>. As founder of Hiroic Productions, he performed
	and produced the English version of <i><strong>Being at Home with
	Claude</b></i> (Ren&eacute;-Daniel Dubois), seen here at the
	Windsor Fringe back in 2009. At the same festival, he also
	performed in the Jeeperz Crow/Cheshire Unicorn co-production of
	<i><strong>Crazy Gary&rsquo;s Mobile Disco</b></i> (Gary Owen). Lorne
	was also proud to be involved the indie film <i><strong>Kidnap Capital</b></i>
	(Felip&eacute; Rodriguez), which received rave reviews in the film
	festival circuit.</p>
	
	<p >
	As a child, through his father's influence in both Zen Buddhism
	and art, Lorne was always a big believer in the mystical nature of
	life and the power of story. It isn't surprising then that the
	kind of stories that influenced and inspired him most where
	fantastical. His biggest dream: to find a mentor that could guide
	him to <i>&ldquo;the ways of the force</i>. It took him many
	decades but eventually, he did find two. A transcendentalist
	teacher by the name of Mary Morrissey and a
	chiropractor/neuroscientist by the name of Dr. Joe Dispenza helped
	Lorne open his eyes to the teachings of Henry David Thoreau and
	Albert Einstein, teaching him how to appreciate his imagination,
	intuition and the power of thought and ever since then, he&rsquo;s
	approaching life with far greater confidence and joy than ever
	before.</p>

	<p >
	<strong>SALLY JONES</b> (director): Sally has been an actor, director
	and producer in the US and Canada. She received her Masters and
	PhD in Drama from the University of Toronto. From 2000 to 2011 she
	was the Artistic Director of the Dora Award winning <i>Rasik Arts</i>,
	Canada&rsquo;s first theatre company devoted to South Asian
	theatre. When she first came to Toronto she remembers the ROM was
	&lsquo;under construction&rsquo; and it seemed to be forever
	since. In 1984 she vividly remembers the Japanese performance
	group <i>Sankai Juku</i> hanging down the north side of the ROM
	into the green grass that is now the Lee-Chin Crystal entrance.
	She has performed in the ROM twice, and has directed two other
	projects that took place in the ROM &ndash; one a specially
	written piece by Deepak Morris taking place in the South Asian
	exhibit.</p>

	<strong>ERIN ELDERSHAW</b> (fight choreographer): Erin is a
	Toronto-based actor, dancer, and fighter, currently certified as
	an Advanced Actor Combatant with the <i>Fight Directors of Canada</i>.
	As a fight choreographer, independent theatre credits include:
	<i><strong>Getting Odd</b></i> (HollyWould Productions), <i><strong>Snow
	White</b></i> (The Army of Sass Toronto), and will be fighting in
	an upcoming short film <i><strong>The Witness Box</b></i> (Witness Box
	Productions). Erin wants to thank Luke Marty for being her
	constant mentor / partner in all things. Quick memory: performing
	a puppet version of <i><strong>Hamlet</b></i> in the basement of the
	Royal Ontario Museum with only four cast members to an audience of
	three hundred rowdy children on their March Break (Shakey-Shake
	and Friends).</p>

	<p >
	<strong>FIONA HAQUE</b> (actor): Fiona has been blessed with many
	exceptional mentors throughout her dance and theatre training:
	people who taught her skills and concepts that have helped to
	shape her as an artist whether it was how to write in iambic
	pentameter or the minutiae of how to &quot;be&quot; a turkey. But
	when it comes down to it, nearly everything she does seems to come
	back to her main man, Billy Shakes. She read his <i><strong>Romeo &amp;
	Juliet</b></i>, in the sixth grade and ever since then, she knew
	that she had to spend the rest of her life affecting people that
	way and creating something just as moving and meaningful.

	<p >
	<strong>TRACY RANKIN</b> (actor): Recent theatre credits include: <i><strong>The
	Stronger</b></i> and <i><strong>The Way of All Fish </b></i>(Kourage
	Theatre), <i><strong>Forests </b></i>and <i><strong>Three Sisters </b></i>(Durham
	Arts Resource Centre), <i><strong>Welcome Death</b></i> (Fourth Line
	Theatre). She also recently wrote and staged her first solo play
	<i><strong>In the Valleys We Grow</b></i> (SOULO Theatre) and looks
	forward to expanding and remounting the play later this year. 
	</p>
	
	<p >
	Her transformational mentorship moment happened when she was a
	young theatre student taking a summer program in Surrey England.
	She headed to London for the day to catch some West End theatre
	and watched Vanessa Redgrave perform the role of Isadora Duncan in
	When She Danced. Tracy was in awe of the power of her presence and
	how she captured an entire audience by her profoundly beautiful
	portrayal. At that moment in time, there was nothing else that she
	wanted to do or achieve in her life. Just to capture those live
	moments of stillness on a stage seemed to me to be the most
	incredible life possible!</p>

	<p >
	<strong>GABRIEL CAMERON </b>(actor): Gabriel was born in Hertfordshire
	and attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art where he received
	the Merriam T Thornbury Award of Distinguishment as well as the
	C.M. Burns Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Field of
	Excellence&hellip; Ok so none of that is true, but it sounded
	cool, didn't it? And you totally believed it for a second.
	Alright, here's the truth:</p>
	
	<p >
	Gabriel got into acting through improv during high school and
	currently study's at Lonsdale Smith &amp; Co Studios, which has
	not only helped him grow as an artist but as a person as well. He
	credits his cousin and mentor Stefano DiMatteo, for spurring many
	changes in his life. He remembers one conversation in particular
	where he was posed the question; &quot;what do you want to do with
	your life?&quot; Gabriel was drifting aimlessly through life at
	the time and had no response. Fast forward a few years later and
	Gabriel is pursuing what he loves. He would like to thank Stefano
	for his unending support and guidance.</p>

	<p >
	<strong>CHRISTOPHER ZAMAT</b> (actor): Chris is immensely grateful to
	all the teachers and mentors whose paths he has been fortunate
	enough to cross so early on his journey through acting. In
	particular, he is indebted to Shannon Lawson for all of the blood,
	sweat and tears she has painstakingly put in to help mentor and
	shape Chris, not only as an actor and artist, but as a person as
	well. Having worked with the likes of Shirley Maclaine, Samuel L.
	Jackson, and Jeff Daniels, Shannon has been able to share her
	experiences as a Canadian award-winning actress; not only in the
	form of invaluable skills and tools for the craft, but also in the
	form of guidance and wisdom in all things relating to acting,
	relationships, business and life. Shannon has always, always been
	there for Chris as a teacher, mentor and a friend, and Chris will
	always be eternally indebted to her for her friendship, and for
	teaching him not to put her to sleep.</p>
