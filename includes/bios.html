	<p>JANET BANKS (writer):
  “I am inspired by the human condition as it unfolds around me a
  million times every day, next door and across the oceans. I have
  had the opportunity to travel the world and observe how the human
  condition is informed by culture, history and world events.
  People tell me stories and I attempt to capture them for the
  stage.”</p>
   <p>Janet worked for the Royal
  Ontario Museum from 1984 - 1990  as
  a security administrator; then promoted to Head of
  Security two years later. This promotion was
  historical as she was the first woman to hold this type of
  management position at the museum and in
  addition to this, she was the youngest
  person to do so. During her career, a few highlights
  included shaking hands with Queen Elizabeth II, playing hide and
  seek with an international jewel thief and personally escorting
  the road transport of precious Jewish artifacts, from Houston to
  Toronto, while under a terrorist threat from the PLO.</p>
   <p>Written plays
  (unpublished) include: <em>The
  Acorn Trilogy</em> (<em>Dirty Little Secret</em>, <em>My Brother’s
  Keeper,</em> and <em>Inspiration Stump</em>), <em>1000 Cleopatras</em>, <em>Hand Washing
  Techniques</em>, <em>Pilgrimage</em>, <em>Season Tickets</em>, <em>Maybe It's
  Mabeleen</em>, <em>Rice Pudding</em>, <em>In the Beginning</em>, <em>Wilde’s
  Women</em> and <em>Sundance</em><em>,</em> of which four were produced.</p>
   <p>Janet has had the
  privilege of having two incredible mentors: the Interim
  Head of Security of the ROM who hired her, and Timothy Findley.
  When she first met Timothy, it was in a class for aspiring
  writers. While critiquing students’ work in
  class and after reading her first piece, Timothy told
  Janet: “<em>All I
  can say to you is just keep
  writing</em>.” Before he
  passed away, Janet had the amazing experience of corresponding
  with Timothy while she wrote <em>Pilgrimage</em>.</p>
   <p><em>Mentor Me Through This Wonderland</em>
  was originally an unfinished book
  entitled <em>Friends with Benefits</em> and was adapted for the stage by her widowed
  husband, Lorne Hiro. Janet passed away November 2011.</p>

	<p>LORNE HIRO (actor, writer, producer): Lorne was privileged to
  perform in three of Janet’s plays: (<em>My Brother’s Keeper</em>,
  <em>Maybe It’s Mabeleen,</em> and <em>Inspiration Stump</em>) and to
  direct <em>Rice Pudding</em>. As founder of Hiroic Productions, he
  performed and produced the English version of René-Daniel Dubois’
  <em><a target="_blank" href="http://hiroic.com/claude">Being At Home With
  Claude</a></strong></em></em>, as seen at the London (ON),
  Hamilton and Windsor Fringe Festivals in 2009 and the Toronto
  Fringe Festival in 2010. At the same 2009 festivals, he also
  performed in the Jeeperz Crow/Cheshire Unicorn co-production of
  Gary Owen’s <em>Crazy Gary’s Mobile Disco</em>. Lorne was also
  proud to be involved the indie film 
  <em><strong><a target="_blank" href="http://kidnapcapitalfilm.com/main/">Kidnap Capital</a></strong></em>
  (Felipé Rodriguez), which received rave reviews in the film
  festival circuit.</p>
  <p>As a child, through his father's influence in both Zen
  Buddhism and art, Lorne was always a big believer in the mystical
  nature of life and the power of story. It isn't surprising then
  that the kind of stories that influenced and inspired him most
  were fantastical. His biggest dream since he was a teenager: to
  find a mentor that could guide him to “the ways of the force.” It
  took him many decades but eventually, he did find two: a
  transcendentalist teacher by the name of Mary Morrissey and a
  chiropractor/neuroscientist by the name of Dr. Joe Dispenza. Both
  helped Lorne open his eyes to the writings of Henry David
  Thoreau, Albert Einstein and many others, teaching him how to
  appreciate his imagination, intuition and the power of
  thought.</p>

		<p>SALLY
	  JONES (director): Sally has been an actor, director, and
	  producer in the US and Canada. She received her Masters
	  and PhD in Drama from the University of Toronto. From
	  2000 to 2011 she was the Artistic Director of the Dora Award
	  winning <em>Rasik
	  Arts</em>, Canada’s
	  first theatre company devoted to South Asian
	  theatre . When she first came to Toronto she remembers the
	  ROM was ‘under construction’ and it seemed to be forever since.
	  In 1984 she vividly remembers the Japanese performance
	  group <em>Sankai
	  Juku</em> hanging down the
	  north side of the ROM into the green grass that is now the
	  Lee-Chin Crystal entrance. She has performed in the ROM twice and
	  has directed two other projects that took place in the ROM – one
	  a specially written piece by Deepak Morris taking place in the
	  South Asian exhibit.</p>

He’s been sound engineer for The Ramones, AC/DC, Tom Cochran, Blue Rodeo; Carpenter for <b><i>X-Men</i></b>, <b><i>Resident Evil</i></b>, <b><i>Cinderella Man</i></b>, and <b><i>Murdoch Mysteries</i></b>; stage managed <b><i>Elvis &amp; Dick</i></b> (Toronto Fringe) and have done lighting and sound for <b><i>Sweet Will</i></b><span class="m_-4140910211240947756m_1952281467731131723m_6536462320040231166gmail-m_1388446753997434800gmail-Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>at the Alumnae Theatre in Toronto</p>
		<p>As for his mentor, Jim looks fondly upon his father and the life he led.<span class="m_-4140910211240947756m_1952281467731131723m_6536462320040231166gmail-m_1388446753997434800gmail-Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>At the age of seventeen, he signed up with the RAF so that he could help defend his homeland, England from the Nazi regime. After V-E day travelling with the REF (Royal Expeditionary Force) through Egypt, India and finally Singapore, he helped the Americans defeat the Japanese. His travels, including moving to Canada and settling down always intrigued me and encouraged my own wanderlust. He also had a love for history and culture which is why the ROM has always been one of my favourite places in Toronto.&nbsp;</p>

	<p>FIONA HAQUE (actor):
  Fiona has been blessed with many exceptional mentors throughout
  her dance and theatre training: people who taught her
  skills and concepts that have helped to shape her as an artist
  whether it was how to write in iambic pentameter or the minutiae
  of how to "be" a turkey. But when it comes down to it, nearly
  everything she does seems to come back to her main man, Billy
  Shakes. She read his <em>Romeo &amp;
  Juliet</em>, in the sixth grade
  and ever since then, she knew that she had to spend the rest of
  her life affecting people that way and creating something just as
  moving and meaningful.</p>

	<p>TRACY RANKIN (actor):
  Recent theatre credits
  include: <em>The
  Stronger</em> and T<em>he
  Way of All Fish</em> (Kourage Theatre), <em>Forests</em> and <em>Three
  Sisters</em> (Durham Arts Resource
  Centre), <em>Welcome Death</em> (Fourth
  Line Theatre). She also recently wrote and staged her first solo
  play <em>In
  the</em> <em>Valleys We Grow</em> (SOULO Theatre) and looks forward to expanding and
  remounting the play later this year.</p>
  
   <p>Her transformational
  mentorship moment happened when she was a
  young theatre student taking a summer program in
  Surrey, England. She headed to London for the day to catch some
  West End theatre and watched Vanessa Redgrave perform
  the role of Isadora Duncan in <em>When She
  Danced</em>. Tracy was in awe of
  the power of her presence and how she captured an entire audience
  by her profoundly beautiful portrayal. At that moment in time,
  there was nothing else that she wanted to do or achieve in her
  life. Just to capture those live moments of stillness on a stage
  seemed to me to be the most incredible life possible!</p>

	<p>GABRIEL
  CAMERON (actor): Gabriel was born in Hertfordshire and
  attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art where he received the
  Merriam T Thornbury Award of Distinguishment as well as the C.M.
  Burns Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Field of
  Excellence... Okay, so none of that is true, but it sounded cool,
  didn't it? And you totally believed it for a second. Alright,
  here's the truth:</p>
   <p>Gabriel got into acting
  through improv during high school and currently studies at
  Lonsdale Smith & Co Studios, which has not only helped him grow
  as an artist but as a person as well. He credits his cousin
  and mentor Stefano DiMatteo for spurring many changes
  in his life. He remembers one conversation in particular where
  he was posed the question; "what do you want to do with
  your life?" Gabriel was drifting aimlessly through life at the
  time and had no response. Fast forward a few years later and
  Gabriel is pursuing what he loves. He would like to thank Stefano
  for his unending support and guidance.</p>

	<p>CHRISTOPHER
  ZAMAT (actor): Chris is immensely grateful to all the
  teachers and mentors whose paths he has been fortunate enough to
  cross so early on his journey through acting. In particular, he
  is indebted to Shannon Lawson for all of the blood, sweat, and
  tears she has painstakingly put in to help mentor and shape
  Chris, not only as an actor and artist but as a person as well.
  Having worked with the likes of Shirley Maclaine, Samuel L.
  Jackson, and Jeff Daniels, Shannon has been able to share her
  experiences as a Canadian award-winning actress; not only in the
  form of invaluable skills and tools for the craft, but also in
  the form of guidance and wisdom in all things relating to acting,
  relationships, business and life. Shannon has always, always been
  there for Chris as a teacher, mentor, and a friend, and Chris
  will always be eternally indebted to her for her friendship, and
  for teaching him not to put her to sleep.</p>

		"Always say Yes". Call it perfectionism, call it laziness, call it depression. What ever it was, it had Adam paralyzed. Scared to fail, scared to succeed, scared to try, he was in a rut. His best friend Lorne (not the one you're thinking of) convinced Adam to come work and help him start his construction company. "But I've never even held a power tool before", Adam said. "Well, that's a great reason to try it, not an excuse to avoid it,” Lorne replied. That was lesson #1 . So he did. He got pretty good at it. Over the next couple of years the business grew. They had a few employees. One day Lorne said to him, "I need a vacation. I'm going over-seas for 3 weeks and leaving you in charge". Adam replied, ”But I don't know what to do... what if the customer asks me to do something and I don't know how?" "Always say Yes " Lorne replied simply. "You can figure out the how later." This was just lesson #1 all over again. But now, Adam understood it. Always say yes. It has become his mantra.

	<img class="bio__pic" alt="" src="images/bios/mobile/Francesco-Galle.jpg" />
	<p>FRANCESCO GALLÉ 
  (artist) is an established painter, illustrator and graphic
  artist in Canada and his native Italy. Born in the southern
  region of Calabria, he emigrated with his family at the age of
  six and grew up in Toronto’s Little Italy, where he still lives
  today.</p>
   <p>Gallé credits his
  childhood days in the mountain town of Serra San Bruno with his
  affinity for the Canadian wilderness, a major subject of his
  work. His desire to preserve this natural landscape and our
  connection with it are entwined with the other key
  theme of his art: paying homage to the traditions of southern
  Italian culture.</p>
   <p>Gallé’s eclectic style
  employs techniques as diverse as pencil drawing and non-brush
  painting. Often the simplicity of composition and prominent use
  of white space recall old master drawings. At times his heavy
  brushstrokes and saturated colours are more akin to the
  work of his mentor, celebrated Canadian abstract artist Richard
  Gorman.</p>
   <p>His work has been
  exhibited widely, including shows at the Bata Shoe Museum, De
  Luca Fine Art Gallery, and the Lonsdale Gallery (Toronto),
  and Palazzio Florio (Sicily). Awards include Applied
  Arts (2008, 2009) in Canada and a Certosa (2009) in
  Italy.</p>

	<p>
		FRANK HORVAT (composer, opening theme music) An accomplished multi-genre 
		composer who has made the tricky musical leap that allows him to pursue a 
		niche of his own, Frank Horvat gives his audience time and space to reflect
		in our fast-paced world. His compositions tell deeply personal stories while
		permitting audiences to ponder their own. Whether he writes for his band,
		the concert stage or film/TV, his music is both aggressive and 
		introspective. Influenced by the post-modern idea of eclecticism,
		his compositions have a driving minimalism and a haunting reflection.
		Frank’s works are often based on social injustices, as well as the
		wondrousness of life and love. Learn about his upcoming album releases
