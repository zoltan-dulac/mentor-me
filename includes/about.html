	Once upon a time, in 1984 a twenty-seven year old woman named Janet Banks was reassessing her career choice. Up until that point, she had spent seven years at The Bay finding her niche as a very successful security officer. But the job was burning her out and she needed something to rejuvenate her spirit so she could get a better idea of what to do with the rest of her life.

	Then the opportunity of a lifetime knocked on her door: an “easy desk-job” as a security administrator at the Royal Ontario Museum, a wonderland for her like no other. It was the chance to come to work everyday and be surrounded by awe-inspiring art and artefacts as well as scientific and natural wonders. And because the job would be way simpler to what she had been used to, she would have the chance to reinvent herself, explore her softer side and figure out what to do with the rest of her life.

	Little did she know that this “mentorship” was going to be way more than she ever expected!

	<b><i>Mentor Me Through This Wonderland</i></b> is based on actual events that happened at the ROM, set in a time when women were just beginning to work their way into gaining a foothold into the “old boys club”. It was adapted by Lorne Hiro from from the first two chapters of the unpublished memoirs of Janet Banks originally entitled, <b><i>Friends with Benefits</i></b>.
