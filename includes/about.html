<p>Once upon a time, in 1984,
  a twenty-seven-year-old woman named Janet Banks was reassessing
  her career choice. Up until that point, she had spent seven years
  at The Bay; finding her niche as a very successful security
  officer. Janet’s job was burning her out and she needed to
  rejuvenate her spirit.</p>
   <p>Then the opportunity of a
  lifetime knocked on her door; an “easy desk job” as a security
  administrator at the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM). This
  would be a wonderland for her like no other. It was the
  chance to come to work every day and be surrounded by
  awe-inspiring art and artifacts as well as scientific and natural
  wonders. This job would be much simpler
  than her previous one and
  would give Janet a chance to reinvent
  herself, explore her softer side and figure out what to do with
  the rest of her life.</p>
   <p>Little did she know that
  this “mentorship” was going to be way more than she ever
  expected!</p>
   <p><em>Mentor Me Through</em> <em>This
  Wonderland</em> is based on
  actual events that happened at the Royal Ontario Museum
  and is set at a time when women were beginning to gain
  a foothold into the “old boys club”. Adapted by Lorne
  Hiro, <em>Mentor Me
  Through</em> <em>This Wonderland</em> is from the first two chapters of the unpublished
  memoirs of Janet Banks and was originally
  entitled, <em>Friends with Benefits</em>.</p>
