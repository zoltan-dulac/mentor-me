<p>Once upon a time, in 1984 a twenty-seven year old woman named Janet Banks was getting ready to embark on an exciting new career path at the Royal Ontario Museum. After being burnt out as the youngest and one of the more successful security supervisors for The Bay, she was ready to downgrade to a routine desk job as a security administrator because it meant working in a wonderland that would help inspire her to figure out what to do with the rest of her life. Little did she know what Wonderland had in store for her.

Within the first day, she witnesses “a wrestling match to enforce access policies,” a grievance claim regarding “air flow in the groin area” and a curator calling upon the security supervisors to help protect him and his daughter from a homicidal scorned lover. If this is just day one at the museum, does she dare come back to see what tomorrow may bring?

	Mentor Me Through This Wonderland is based on actual events that happened at the ROM, set in a time when women were just beginning to work their way into gaining a foothold into the “old boys club”. It was adapted by Lorne Hiro from from the first two chapters of the unpublished memoirs of Janet Banks originally entitled, Friends with Benefits.
