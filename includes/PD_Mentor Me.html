			Janet worked for the Royal Ontario Museum between 1984-1990: first
			as a security administrator, but then promoted to Head of Security
			2 years later, making her not only the first woman hired for the
			job but also the youngest person ever. During her career, a few
			highlights included shaking hands with Queen Elizabeth II, playing
			hide and seek with an international jewel thief and personally
			escorting the road transport of precious Jewish artifacts from
			Houston to Toronto while under a terrorist threat from the PLO.</p>

			name, unfortunately isn&rsquo;t available, and Timothy Findley.
			When she first met Timothy, it was in a class for aspiring
			writers. While critiquing students&rsquo; work in class, after
			reading her first piece, Timothy told Janet: <i>&ldquo;All I can
			say to you is just keep writing.&rdquo;</i> Before he passed away,
			Janet had the amazing experience of corresponding with Timothy
			while she wrote <i><b>Pilgrimage</b></i>.</p>

			and <i><b>Inspiration Stump</b></i>) and to direct <i><b>Rice
			Pudding</b></i>. As founder of Hiroic Productions, he performed
			and produced the English version of <i><b>Being at Home with
			Claude</b></i> (Ren&eacute;-Daniel Dubois), seen here at the
			Windsor Fringe back in 2009. At the same festival, he also
			performed in the Jeeperz Crow/Cheshire Unicorn co-production of

			As a child, through his father's influence in both Zen Buddhism
			and art, Lorne was always a big believer in the mystical nature of
			life and the power of story. It isn't surprising then that the
			kind of stories that influenced and inspired him most where
			fantastical. His biggest dream: to find a mentor that could guide
			him to <i>&ldquo;the ways of the force</i>. It took him many
			decades but eventually, he did find two. A transcendentalist
			teacher by the name of Mary Morrissey and a
			chiropractor/neuroscientist by the name of Dr. Joe Dispenza helped
			Lorne open his eyes to the teachings of Henry David Thoreau and
			Albert Einstein, teaching him how to appreciate his imagination,
			intuition and the power of thought and ever since then, he&rsquo;s
			approaching life with far greater confidence and joy than ever
			before.</p>

			group <i>Sankai Juku</i> hanging down the north side of the ROM
			into the green grass that is now the Lee-Chin Crystal entrance.
			She has performed in the ROM twice, and has directed two other

			Her transformational mentorship moment happened when she was a
			young theatre student taking a summer program in Surrey England.
			She headed to London for the day to catch some West End theatre
			and watched Vanessa Redgrave perform the role of Isadora Duncan in
			When She Danced. Tracy was in awe of the power of her presence and
			how she captured an entire audience by her profoundly beautiful
			portrayal. At that moment in time, there was nothing else that she
			wanted to do or achieve in her life. Just to capture those live
			moments of stillness on a stage seemed to me to be the most
			incredible life possible!</p>
