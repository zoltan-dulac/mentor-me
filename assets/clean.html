   <p><strong>About</strong></p>
   <p>Once upon a time, in 1984,
  a twenty-seven-year-old woman named Janet Banks was reassessing
  her career choice. Up until that point, she had spent seven years
  at The Bay; finding her niche as a very successful security
  officer. Janet’s job was burning her out and she needed to
  rejuvenate her spirit.</p>
   <p>Then the opportunity of a
  lifetime knocked on her door; an “easy desk job” as a security
  administrator at the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM). This
  would be a wonderland for her like no other. It was the
  chance to come to work every day and be surrounded by
  awe-inspiring art and artifacts as well as scientific and natural
  wonders. This job would be much simpler
  than her previous one and
  would give Janet a chance to reinvent
  herself, explore her softer side and figure out what to do with
  the rest of her life.</p>
   <p>Little did she know that
  this “mentorship” was going to be way more than she ever
  expected!</p>
   <p><em>Mentor Me Through This
  Wonderland</em> is based on
  actual events that happened at the Royal Ontario Museum
  and is set at a time when women were beginning to gain
  a foothold into the “old boys club”. Adapted by Lorne
  Hiro, <em>Mentor Me
  Through This Wonderland</em> is from the first two chapters of the unpublished
  memoirs of Janet Banks and was originally
  entitled, <em>Friends with Benefits</em>.</p>
   <p><strong>Bios</strong></p>
   <p>JANET BANKS (writer):
  “I am inspired by the human condition as it unfolds around me a
  million times every day, next door and across the oceans. I have
  had the opportunity to travel the world and observe how the human
  condition is informed by culture, history and world events.
  People tell me stories and I attempt to capture them for the
  stage.”</p>
   <p>Janet worked for the Royal
  Ontario Museum from 1984 - 1990  as
  a security administrator; then promoted to Head of
  Security two years later. This promotion was
  historical as she was the first woman to hold this type of
  management position at the museum and in
  addition to this, she was the youngest
  person to do so. During her career, a few highlights
  included shaking hands with Queen Elizabeth II, playing hide and
  seek with an international jewel thief and personally escorting
  the road transport of precious Jewish artifacts, from Houston to
  Toronto, while under a terrorist threat from the PLO.</p>
   <p>Written plays
  (unpublished) include: </p>
   <p><em>The
  Acorn Trilogy (Dirty Little Secret, My Brother’s
  Keeper,</em> and <em>Inspiration Stump), 1000 Cleopatras, Hand Washing
  Techniques, Pilgrimage, Season Tickets, Maybe its
  Mabeleen, Rice Pudding, In the Beginning, Wilde’s
  Women</em> and<em> Sundance</em><em>,</em> of which four were produced.</p>
   <p>Janet has had the
  privilege of having two incredible mentors: the Interim
  Head of Security of the ROM who hired her, and Timothy Findley.
  When she first met Timothy, it was in a class for aspiring
  writers. While critiquing students’ work in
  class and after reading her first piece, Timothy told
  Janet: “<em>All I
  can say to you is just keep
  writing</em>.” Before he
  passed away, Janet had the amazing experience of corresponding
  with Timothy while she wrote <em>Pilgrimage</em>.</p>
   <p><em>Mentor Me Through This Wonderland</em>
  was originally an unfinished book
  entitled <em>Friends with Benefits</em> and was adapted for the stage by her widowed
  husband, Lorne Hiro. Janet passed away November 2011.</p>
   
   <p>LORNE HIRO (actor,
  writer, producer): Lorne was privileged to perform in
  three of Janet’s plays: (<em>My Brother’s Keeper, Maybe It’s
  Mabeleen,</em> and<em> Inspiration Stump</em>)
  and to direct <em>Rice Pudding</em>. As founder
  of Hiroic Productions, he performed and produced the English
  version of <em>Being at Home with Claude</em> (René-Daniel Dubois), as seen at the London
  (ON), Hamilton and Windsor Fringe Festivals in 2009 and the
  Toronto Fringe Festival in 2010. At the same 2009 festival, he
  also performed in the  Jeeperz Crow/Cheshire Unicorn
  co-production of <em>Crazy Gary’s Mobile Disco</em> (Gary Owen). Lorne was also proud to be involved the
  indie film <em><strong>Kidnap Capital</strong></em> (Felipé Rodriguez), which received rave reviews in the
  film festival circuit.</p>
   
   <p>SALLY
  JONES (director): Sally has been an actor, director, and
  producer in the US and Canada. She received her Masters
  and PhD in Drama from the University of Toronto. From
  2000 to 2011 she was the Artistic Director of the Dora Award
  winning <em>Rasik
  Arts</em>, Canada’s
  first theatre company devoted to South Asian
  theatre . When she first came to Toronto she remembers the
  ROM was ‘under construction’ and it seemed to be forever since.
  In 1984 she vividly remembers the Japanese performance
  group <em>Sankai
  Juku</em> hanging down the
  north side of the ROM into the green grass that is now the
  Lee-Chin Crystal entrance. She has performed in the ROM twice and
  has directed two other projects that took place in the ROM – one
  a specially written piece by Deepak Morris taking place in the
  South Asian exhibit.</p>
   
   <p>ERIN ELDERSHAW (fight
  choreographer): Erin is a Toronto-based actor, dancer, and
  fighter, currently certified as an Advanced Actor Combatant with
  the Fight Directors of Canada. As a fight choreographer,
  independent theatre credits
  include: <em>Getting Odd</em> (HollyWould
  Productions), <em>Snow White</em> (The
  Army of Sass Toronto), and will be fighting in an upcoming short
  film <em>The
  Witness Box</em> (Witness Box
  Productions). Erin wants to thank Luke Marty for being her
  constant mentor/partner in all things. Quick memory: performing a
  puppet version of <em>Hamlet</em> in the
  basement of the Royal Ontario Museum with only four cast members
  to an audience of three hundred rowdy children on their March
  Break (Shakey-Shake and Friends).</p>
   
   <p>FIONA HAQUE (actor):
  Fiona has been blessed with many exceptional mentors throughout
  her dance and theatre training: people who taught her
  skills and concepts that have helped to shape her as an artist
  whether it was how to write in iambic pentameter or the minutiae
  of how to "be" a turkey. But when it comes down to it, nearly
  everything she does seems to come back to her main man, Billy
  Shakes. She read his <em>Romeo &
  Juliet</em>, in the sixth grade
  and ever since then, she knew that she had to spend the rest of
  her life affecting people that way and creating something just as
  moving and meaningful.</p>
   
   <p>TRACY RANKIN (actor):
  Recent theatre credits
  include: <em>The
  Stronger</em> and T<em>he
  Way of All Fish</em> (Kourage Theatre), <em>Forests</em> and <em>Three
  Sisters</em> (Durham Arts Resource
  Centre), <em>Welcome Death</em> (Fourth
  Line Theatre). She also recently wrote and staged her first solo
  play <em>In
  the</em> <em>Valleys We Grow</em> (SOULO Theatre) and looks forward to expanding and
  remounting the play later this year.</p>
   <p>Her transformational
  mentorship moment happened when she was a
  young theatre student taking a summer program in
  Surrey, England. She headed to London for the day to catch some
  West End theatre and watched Vanessa Redgrave perform
  the role of Isadora Duncan in <em>When She
  Danced</em>. Tracy was in awe of
  the power of her presence and how she captured an entire audience
  by her profoundly beautiful portrayal. At that moment in time,
  there was nothing else that she wanted to do or achieve in her
  life. Just to capture those live moments of stillness on a stage
  seemed to me to be the most incredible life possible!</p>
   
   <p>GABRIEL
  CAMERON (actor): Gabriel was born in Hertfordshire and
  attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art where he received the
  Merriam T Thornbury Award of Distinguishment as well as the C.M.
  Burns Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Field of
  Excellence… Ok so none of that is true, but it sounded cool,
  didn't it? And you totally believed it for a second. Alright,
  here's the truth:</p>
   <p>Gabriel got into acting
  through improv during high school and currently studies at
  Lonsdale Smith & Co Studios, which has not only helped him grow
  as an artist but as a person as well. He credits his cousin
  and mentor Stefano DiMatteo for spurring many changes
  in his life. He remembers one conversation in particular where
  he was posed the question; "what do you want to do with
  your life?" Gabriel was drifting aimlessly through life at the
  time and had no response. Fast forward a few years later and
  Gabriel is pursuing what he loves. He would like to thank Stefano
  for his unending support and guidance.</p>
   
   <p>CHRISTOPHER
  ZAMAT (actor): Chris is immensely grateful to all the
  teachers and mentors whose paths he has been fortunate enough to
  cross so early on his journey through acting. In particular, he
  is indebted to Shannon Lawson for all of the blood, sweat, and
  tears she has painstakingly put in to help mentor and shape
  Chris, not only as an actor and artist but as a person as well.
  Having worked with the likes of Shirley Maclaine, Samuel L.
  Jackson, and Jeff Daniels, Shannon has been able to share her
  experiences as a Canadian award-winning actress; not only in the
  form of invaluable skills and tools for the craft, but also in
  the form of guidance and wisdom in all things relating to acting,
  relationships, business and life. Shannon has always, always been
  there for Chris as a teacher, mentor, and a friend, and Chris
  will always be eternally indebted to her for her friendship, and
  for teaching him not to put her to sleep.</p>
   
   <p>FRANCESCO GALLÉ 
  (artist) is an established painter, illustrator and graphic
  artist in Canada and his native Italy. Born in the southern
  region of Calabria, he emigrated with his family at the age of
  six and grew up in Toronto’s Little Italy, where he still lives
  today.</p>
   <p>Gallé credits his
  childhood days in the mountain town of Serra San Bruno with his
  affinity for the Canadian wilderness, a major subject of his
  work. His desire to preserve this natural landscape and our
  connection with it are entwined with the other key
  theme of his art: paying homage to the traditions of southern
  Italian culture.</p>
   <p>Gallé’s eclectic style
  employs techniques as diverse as pencil drawing and non-brush
  painting. Often the simplicity of composition and prominent use
  of white space recall old master drawings. At times his heavy
  brushstrokes and saturated colours are more akin to the
  work of his mentor, celebrated Canadian abstract artist Richard
  Gorman.</p>
   <p>His work has been
  exhibited widely, including shows at the Bata Shoe Museum, De
  Luca Fine Art Gallery, and the Lonsdale Gallery (Toronto),
  and Palazzio Florio (Sicily). Awards include Applied
  Arts (2008, 2009) in Canada and a Certosa (2009) in
  Italy.</p>

  websites since the web began in the 1990s. Along with creating
  award-winning websites for major Canadian and global brands, he

  Pudding, </em><em class=

  Disco</em>. When he's not coding
  for clients, he writes about the latest web technologies on his
  blog <strong>User Agent
  Man </strong>and acts as the lead
  crooner with his lounge-punk band, <strong>Conflicting Plaid</strong>.</p>
