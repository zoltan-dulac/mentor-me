  <p>LORNE HIRO (actor, writer, producer): Lorne was privileged to
  perform in three of Janet’s plays: (<em>My Brother’s Keeper</em>,
  <em>Maybe It’s Mabeleen,</em> and <em>Inspiration Stump</em>) and to
  direct <em>Rice Pudding</em>. As founder of Hiroic Productions, he
  performed and produced the English version of René-Daniel Dubois’
  <em>Being at Home with Claude</em>, as seen at the London (ON),
  Hamilton and Windsor Fringe Festivals in 2009 and the Toronto
  Fringe Festival in 2010. At the same 2009 festivals, he also
  performed in the Jeeperz Crow/Cheshire Unicorn co-production of
  Gary Owen’s <em>Crazy Gary’s Mobile Disco</em>. Lorne was also
  proud to be involved the indie film <em><strong>Kidnap Capital</strong></em>
  (Felipé Rodriguez), which received rave reviews in the film
  festival circuit.</p>
  <p>As a child, through his father's influence in both Zen
  Buddhism and art, Lorne was always a big believer in the mystical
  nature of life and the power of story. It isn't surprising then
  that the kind of stories that influenced and inspired him most
  were fantastical. His biggest dream since he was a teenager: to
  find a mentor that could guide him to “the ways of the force.” It
  took him many decades but eventually, he did find two: a
  transcendentalist teacher by the name of Mary Morrissey and a
  chiropractor/neuroscientist by the name of Dr. Joe Dispenza. Both
  helped Lorne open his eyes to the writings of Henry David
  Thoreau, Albert Einstein and many others, teaching him how to
  appreciate his imagination, intuition and the power of
  thought.</p>
